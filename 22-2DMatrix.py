# Introduction: A magic square is a 2D matrix composed of n^2 integers where 
# n is the length of one row or column. In a magic square each row, 
# each column, and the two diagonals must sum to the same value.

# Problem: Given a 2D matrix, your program must determine 
# if the square is magic or not magic. It will print "magic" or 
# "non magic" accordingly.
# Input: Your program will first take an input n, representing 
# the length of one row of the matrix from the user. It will then 
# take n lines of input containing n integers separated by spaces from the user.
